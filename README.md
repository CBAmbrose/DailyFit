DailyFit is a program that uses the OpenWeather API to check the current weather, so that an outfit can be developed for the day.
The program is broken up into three files, main.py, outfit.py, and weather.py. Main calls both functions and prints the results, 
weather.py calls the API to find the tempuerature, and outfit.py takes in the tempurature and randomly chooses pieces of clothing
depending on the weather outside. 

Instructions:
Simply compile and run the code and an outfit will be generated based on the temperature outside. The current program is based around
my closet and my tolerance to temperatures. Both of these aspects can be customized by altering the variables in weather.py
